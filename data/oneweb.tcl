# * A Walker polar star geometry. Note the 'orbital seam' where
# * the footprints of ascending (going north over the Equator) and
# * descending (going (south) satellites overlap more to ensure
# * continuous coverage.

# * This simulation is a rough approximation, based only on news reports.
# * It is speculative, not authoritative, and not finalised.

# * "OneWebâ€™s 150-kilogram satellites will operate in an orbit
# * 1,200 kilometers in altitude, in 18 planes of 40 satellites each,
# * with an inclination of 87.9 degrees relative to the equator."
